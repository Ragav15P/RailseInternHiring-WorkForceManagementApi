# Workforce Management API ðŸš€

A lightweight Spring Boot application for managing operational tasks, built as part of the assignment requirements.  
It supports **smart task fetching**, **task prioritization**, and **real-time comments & activity history tracking**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This API helps operations teams manage their daily tasks efficiently.  
It allows employees to:
- View their relevant work for a specific day (or date range).
- Get tasks that are still pending from previous days.
- Prioritize work according to urgency.
- Collaborate via task comments and view a full history of changes.

---

## âœ¨ Features

### **Part 0 & Part 1 â€“ Bug Fixes**
1. **Duplicate Active Task Bug (Fixed)**  
   - When reassigning tasks by reference, old active tasks are now cancelled before assigning a new one.
2. **Cancelled Tasks in Fetch Bug (Fixed)**  
   - Date-based fetching now excludes `CANCELLED` tasks and includes active tasks from before the date range.

---

### **Part 2 â€“ New Features**
#### 1. Smart Daily Task View
- When fetching tasks by date range:
  - Returns **all active tasks started in that range**.
  - Returns **all active tasks started before the range but still open**.

#### 2. Task Priority
- Tasks have a `priority` field: `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`.
- **Endpoints**:
  - Update priority of a task.
  - Fetch all tasks of a specific priority.

#### 3. Task Comments & Activity History
- Add free-text comments to tasks.
- Automatically logs important actions such as:
  - Task creation
  - Priority change
  - Comments added
- View task details including:
  - Core task information
  - Activity history
  - All comments (sorted chronologically)
